# Sorting Algorithms (AVision)
This repository represents a project for visualizing sorting algorithms in java using JavaFX. The application has more than 20 sorting algorithms and 
it is possible to change the speed of the visualization and the size of the array.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to visualize sorting algorithms to help anyone understand how they work and how they are implemented. Sorting in general is a very important topic in
computer science, and it is used in many applications and improving its performance is very important and constantly researched.



## Features

- Friendly GUI.
- Visualize sorting algorithms.
- More than 20 sorting algorithms:
    - Binary Insertion Sort
    - Bitonic Sort
    - Bogo Fort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Bucket Sort
    - Cocktail Shaker Sort
    - Comb Sort
    - Counting Sort
    - Double Selection Sort
    - Gnome Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - In Place Merge Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Odd Even Sort
    - Optimized Bubble Sort
    - Pancake Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Shell Sort
    - Stooge Sort
- Change the speed of the visualization.
- Change the size of the array.



## Installation

The project is written in `Java` and uses `JavaFX` for the GUI. To run the project you need to have `JavaFX` installed and added to your IDE.
The project was developed using `IntelliJ IDEA` and `Java 17`.



## Usage

1. **Choose** the sorting algorithm you want to visualize. 
2. The default **speed** of visualization is `1` so if you want to make it **faster** you can choose a number **less** than `1` and if you want to make it **slower** you can choose a number **greater** than `1`. 
3. The default **size** of the array is `100` so if you want to make it **smaller** you can choose a number **less** than `100` and if you want to make it **bigger** you can choose a number **greater** than `100`. 
4. Click on **Sort** to start the visualization.

## Tests

Each sorting algorithm has its own test class. The tests are written using `JUnit 5`. The tests are written to test the correctness of the sorting algorithms and the performance of the algorithms. The performance tests are written to test the time complexity of the algorithms and the space complexity of the algorithms. 
The tests are written to test the algorithms on different types of arrays:
  - Sort ascending.
  - Sort descending.
  - All values are the positive.
  - There is one element.
  - No negative values in the tests since the bars of the app can't have negative values.

The test can be found [here](https://github.com/Bazina/Sorting-Algorithms/tree/master/src/test/java/Implementation/Sorting/SortingStrategies).
